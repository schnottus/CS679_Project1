        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>You are a prized and beautiful Regal Tang fish! Growing up you always felt superior to 
           other fish and you were always one step ahead of your peers. Because of this, you quickly made it through
           all of your fish training and even the most advanced levels of swimming school were a breeze for you.
           Once you were finished with all of your education, you didn't feel you'd be satisfied to simply find a mate
           and make a family, so instead you aspired to become a teacher yourself!<br><br>
           You spent many hours studying all of the best teaching and leading techniques and eventually passed your
           swim teacher exam! Today is your first day on the job, and you've been tasked with watching a school of Clownfish.
           Everything seemed to be going fine when all of the sudden some predators infiltrated your reef! Because your students
           are all new swimmers, they panicked and started swimming away wildly. As an instructor, you feel it is your duty to
           swim after them and try to save them from the predators for as long as possible. Good luck!
      
        </p>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <p>Try to round up the Clownfish and keep them away from predators for as long as possible. The game will end if either you or all of the Clownfish die.
